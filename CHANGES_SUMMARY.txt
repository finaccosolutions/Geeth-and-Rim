Testing Instructions:
---------------------

1. BOOKING TIMELINE TEST:
   - Go to booking page
   - Select any service
   - Choose a date
   - Check browser console (F12) for logs showing:
     * "Loading bookings for date: [date]"
     * "Bookings result: [data]"
     * "Total bookings loaded: [count]"
   - Visual timeline should show red bars for existing bookings
   - Try selecting a time that overlaps with existing booking
   - Should see error message

2. EMAIL FUNCTIONALITY TEST:
   - First, configure SMTP in Admin Panel:
     * Login at /admin
     * Go to Settings tab
     * Enter SMTP details (host, port, username, password)
     * Add admin email addresses
     * Save settings
   - Make a test booking
   - Check browser console for email logs:
     * "Sending booking emails with settings: [config]"
     * "Customer email response: 200 [result]"
     * "Admin email response: 200 [result]"
   - Check email inboxes for confirmation emails

3. HOME PAGE SERVICES TEST:
   - Navigate to home page
   - Scroll to "Discover Our Services" section
   - Hover over category cards - should see:
     * Card lifts up smoothly
     * Shadow expands
     * Image zooms and brightens
     * Colors transition
   - Click a category - should see:
     * Selected card scales up
     * Gradient background appears

Important Notes:
---------------

1. Email functionality requires SMTP configuration
   - Without SMTP settings, emails will not be sent
   - System will log warnings in console
   - Bookings will still be saved to database

2. Timeline shows ALL bookings for selected date
   - Not filtered by service (as per current implementation)
   - This prevents double-booking any time slots
   - Both regular bookings and blocked slots appear

3. Build completed successfully
   - No errors or warnings
   - All TypeScript checks passed
   - Production ready

4. Visual improvements maintain responsive design
   - Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Touch-friendly on mobile devices
   - Smooth animations on all devices
